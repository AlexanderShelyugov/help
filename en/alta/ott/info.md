# OTT

OTT (Over the Top) media service - is a media service offered directly to viewers via the Internet that bypasses MSO services. It works due to the content delivery network (CDN) that gives an opportunity to video hosts to transmit the data via the Internet. That allows the user to receive media content on any device with access to the Internet. 

> MSO (Multiple System Operator) - is an operator of multiple cable or direct-broadcast satellite television systems.

> CDN (Content Delivery Network or Content Distribution Network) - is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end users.

## How OTT works

1. Broadcasters upload video content to an OTT video hosting platform
2. The video host transmits the data to remote servers via a content delivery network (CDN)
3. Users select the content they want to stream on the user-facing video gallery
4. The video player on the device pulls the video content from the CDNâ€™s server with the internet
