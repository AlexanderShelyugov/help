For authorization you need to enter your server address, login and password

If you have previously been authorized, then you will see a button to go to an already connected server. Each vatization of a new server adds it to the list of connected servers.

## Troubleshooting

??? question "Server unreachable"    
   
    - Invalid server address
    - The server is unreachable - it is not connected to your VPN or your company's private network
    - The user is not connected to the VPN or private company network through which the server is accessed
    - Server communication port closed by firewall
    - Service not running on server


??? question "Invalid Credentials"

    - Invalid login or password. You may [reset your password](/en/alta/quick-start/reset-password/)
