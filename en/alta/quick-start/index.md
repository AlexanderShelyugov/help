# Quick Start

## Requirements

- Any Linux based operation system
- 64bit CPU: x86 or ARM

## Install

Cesbo Alta installation is a simple process â€“ just copy single binary file to your server.

!!! note
    In this guide we use the `curl` command to download files.
    Most Linux distribution has pre-installed `curl`

Download binary file and set execute permission. On the server you may use next command:

```
curl -Lo /usr/bin/alta https://cesbo.com/and/alta-2211
chmod +x /usr/bin/alta
```

## Check version

After installation or after update you may check installed version:

```
alta version
```

## Start service

!!! note
    Service is an application process with specified name and own configuration. You may launch on your server one or more services depends on your need.

After installation need to prepare service for launch with wizard:

```
sudo alta init
```

- `Service name` - name of the service in the system it could be used for configuration file name and to manage service in the system;
- `Config path` - full path to the configuration file. Wizard make parent directories as needed;
- `Admin login` - login for first administrator, after configuration you can create additional users in the web interface;
- `Admin password` - password for administrator. If you specify own password then on the next step wizard asks for password confirmation;
- `Add service systemd` - service will be registered in the Systemd - a service manager for the Linux based systems. This option useful to control service status, check service logs, and launch service on system startup;
- `Enable service autorun` - this option available only with Systemd. Service will be launched automatically on system startup;
- `Start service` - start service immediately after wizard.
