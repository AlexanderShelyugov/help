# CAS and Simulcrypt

Conditional Access System (CAS) - a group of encryption standards to prevent unauthorized access to the services in the broadcast networks.

!!! note
    Methods described in this article has a better efficient only for broadcast networks.

All streams scrambled with CSA (Common Scrambling Algorithm) or AES (Advanced Encryption Standard). Each scrambled stream contains packets with ECM (Entitlement Control Message). ECM is an encrypted key for scrambled stream.
