Astra provides a web interface that you can use to manage and configure the software.

## Accessing the Web Interface

Web Interface works well in next browsers: Firefox, Chrome, or Safari.

The default port for the web interface is 8000. To access the web interface, enter the following URL in your web browser: `http://your-server-address:8000`, where your-server is the IP address or hostname of the server where Astra is installed.
